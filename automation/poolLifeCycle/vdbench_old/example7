*Example 7: File system testing

fsd=fsd1,anchor=/dir1,depth=2,width=2,files=2,size=128k

fwd=fwd1,fsd=fsd1,operation=read,xfersize=4k,fileio=sequential,fileselect=random,threads=2

rd=rd1,fwd=fwd1,fwdrate=100,format=yes,elapsed=10,interval=1

*
* This parameter file will use a directory structure of 4 directories and 8 files
* The RD parameter 'format=yes' causes the directory structure to be completely
* created, including initialization of all files to the requested size of 128k.
* After the format completes the following will happen for 10 seconds at a rate
* of 100 reads per second:
*         Start two threads (threads=2; 1 thread is default).
*         Each thread:
*         Randomly selects a file (fileselect=random)
*         Opens this file for read (operation=read)
*         Sequentially reads 4k blocks (xfersize=4k) until end of file (size=128k)
*         Closes the file and randomly selects another file.
*
*
* Directory structure:
*
* find dir1 | grep file
* dir1/vdb_control.file
* dir1/vdb1_1.dir/vdb2_1.dir/vdb_f0001.file
* dir1/vdb1_1.dir/vdb2_1.dir/vdb_f0002.file
* dir1/vdb1_1.dir/vdb2_2.dir/vdb_f0001.file
* dir1/vdb1_1.dir/vdb2_2.dir/vdb_f0002.file
* dir1/vdb1_2.dir/vdb2_1.dir/vdb_f0001.file
* dir1/vdb1_2.dir/vdb2_1.dir/vdb_f0002.file
* dir1/vdb1_2.dir/vdb2_2.dir/vdb_f0001.file
* dir1/vdb1_2.dir/vdb2_2.dir/vdb_f0002.file
