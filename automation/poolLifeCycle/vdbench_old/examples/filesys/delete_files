* Delete numerous small files and its parent directories.
* For Vdbench to be able to delete files of course it first needs to create
* a bunch of files. It's all in here.
*
* Note: the thread count for the format is taken from fwd0
*

fsd=fsd1,anchor=/dir1,depth=1,width=1,files=1000,size=8k

fwd=default,threads=16
fwd=fwd0,fsd=fsd1,operation=read
fwd=fwd1,fsd=fsd1,operation=delete
fwd=fwd2,fsd=fsd1,operation=rmdir

* This run serves as 'format only'. The 'fwd=fwd0,operation=read' is there to
* bypass a bug in Vdbench500 where including a delete/rmdir in the FWDs
* causes a loop during the format.
rd=format,fwd=fwd0,fwdrate=1,format=yes,elapsed=3,interval=1

* Vdbench will stop after the last file has been deleted
rd=rd_delete,fwd=fwd1,fwdrate=max,elapsed=99999,interval=1

* Vdbench will stop after the last directory has been deleted
rd=rd_rmdir,fwd=fwd2,fwdrate=max,elapsed=99999,interval=1
