* TPCC workload.
* These three Workload Definitions (WD) were created by interpreting
* iostat data from a TPCC run using Sun StorageTek Workload Analysis Tool (Swat).
*
* wd=logs:   24k xfersize, 100% sequential write, at .75% of the total iops
* wd=reads:  a mix of 4k and 8k random reads at 62.5% of the total iops
* wd=writes: a mix of 4k and 8k random writes at 36.75% of the total iops.
