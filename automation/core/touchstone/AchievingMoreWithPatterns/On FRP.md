##### Introduction
This is all about understanding the essence of functional programming. At the
end of this article we shall see if we understood how logic built using functional
techniques are effectively managed than that if imperative programming model. We
shall also understand the differences between functional, reactive, compositional
etc programming models.

##### What is FRP ?
- Functional Reactive Programming
- How is it different from  Reactive Programming ?
  - We shall get to know as I try to understand better.


##### Often used phrases that confuses us all !!!
- Taming asynchronous workflows with functional reactive programming
- Taming asynchronous workflows with compositional event systems


##### Compositional Event Systems - What is this now ?
- Lets try to talk a bit on imperative programming:
  - It implements computations as a series of actions
  - These actions keep on modifying program state
- Now a bit about functional programming:
  - It describes what we want to do.
  - It does not talk about how we want it to be done.
  - There is no variables with local state
