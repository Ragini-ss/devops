##### Discussions around OpenEC
- Architectures - past & present
  - Pets vs Cattles
    - Limiting our thoughts by loving our pets.
    - Solving the real world challenges by embracing a cattle based culture.
- Will we have any pets at all ?
  - Our file system can be our pet.
  - Transforming it to a cattle
    - e.g. we can think open sourcing as one of the many transformations
  - Take a errant cattle, make it your pet & then transform it to an obedient cattle again :)
- What can be OpenElastiCenter (OpenEC) ?
  - where your own thing is a connector or plugin or an adapter.
  - where your own thing is a function or callback.
  - where your own thing does not know of the outside world.
  - where your own thing does only one thing !!!
  - You can have redundant connectors, or plugins or adapters.
    - Business demands !!!
- What feature(s) can not be considered as fit for OpenEC ?
  - If you code your HA.
  - If you code your Monitoring.
  - If you code your Alerting.
  - If you code your State i.e. DB
  - If you script your Installers (ISOs etc.)
  - If you code your XYZ feature rather than your `xyz function.
- Any open datacenter implementations that we may refer ?
  - OpenStack,
  - Hashicorp,
  - Cloud Foundry
  - ???
- Any other implementations that are not datacenter specific but can be transformed to one ?
  - Riak Core - from Basho
  - ???
- Can we embrace one of above ecosystem ?
  - What kind of architecture do you find in above implementations ?
  - What are the short comings of above ?
- Role of a message protocol is crucial when we expose our endpoints.
  - JSON has been the de-facto protocol.
    - NOTE - Folks from Lightbend (formerly TypeSafe) are against any forms of REST.
    - Need to understand why ??
  - We need to think of binary alternatives that are proven in industry.
  - We really would not like to open sub-process as a medium of communication.
  - Language binding offers some help but it couples the system.
    - In other words, micro services goes for a toss.
  - We really don't want to go for shared memory & guarded approaches (refer. Hack from FB)
    - unless & until binary protocols fail to meet our SLAs.
- How does programming languages matter w.r.t an architecture ?
  - Imperative vs Functional
    - => Design Patterns vs. Mathematical functions
    - => Discipline vs Behavior
  - Have you ever wondered why we were not taught of patterns in our schools ?
  - Have you observed the difference between the Maths taught at schools vs engineering Maths?
