README FOR RUNNING ISCSI AND NFS PROTOCOL REGRESSION SUITE
##########################################################

Pre-Requisites :
--------------

1. Ensure the build is installed on the EC/ES boxes with appropriate network configuration 

2. On Elasticenter -  Create Site, HAgroup and construct the disk array

3. Setup the linux client (I/O host, either a physical machine OR VM on a hypervisor) with both management access and data network

4. Setup a working directory of the devops repository on linux client ("git clone https://github.com/cloudbytestorage/devops.git")

Steps to Run the regression suites : 
----------------------------------

Navigate to "devops/automation/protocol_regression/regressionSuite/" 

  Edit the json file "conf.txt" with appropriate values for all keys (mainly, the EC details, VSM and client info)
  View the values set for TSM and Volumes in sample/tsm.txt and nfsvolume.txt/iscsivolume.txt. Edit based on setup capabilities if desired
  Run "sh NfsRegression.sh" & "sh IscsiRegression.sh" to initiate the nfs regression suite and iscsi regression suite 
  (The order is left to the user. The suites need to be run sequentially - i.e., one after another OR on different clients)

Results : 
-------

The results of individual tests will be logged in the devops/automation/protocol_regression/regressionSuite/results/result.csv
