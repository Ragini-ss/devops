README FOR RUNNING ISCSI AND NFS PROTOCOL REGRESSION SUITE
##########################################################

Pre-Requisites :
--------------

1. Ensure the build is installed on the EC/ES boxes with appropriate network configuration 

2. On Elasticenter -  Create Site, HAgroup and construct the disk array. Also create a pool and at least 3 VSMs

3. Setup the linux client (I/O host, either a physical machine OR VM on a hypervisor) with both management access and data network

4. Setup a working directory of the devops repository on linux client ("git clone https://github.com/cloudbytestorage/devops.git")

Steps to Run the regression suites : 
----------------------------------

Navigate to "devops/automation/protocol_regression/regressionSuite/" 

1. Edit the json file "conf.txt" with appropriate values for all keys (mainly, the EC details, VSM and client info) 
  (Note : Please provide an extra VSM IP in the conf file for VSM IP change test)
  
2. Run "sh NfsRegression.sh" & "sh IscsiRegression.sh" to initiate the nfs regression suite and iscsi regression suite 
  (Note : The order is left to the user. The suites need to be run sequentially. 
          Ensure that the system state for start of the suites is the same for both)

The results of individual tests will be logged in the devops/automation/protocol_regression/regressionSuite/results/result.csv
